# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed - 2025-10-16

## Overview
This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities that were addressed in this update.

## Total Vulnerabilities Fixed: 20

### 1. axios Vulnerabilities (5 vulnerabilities) - FIXED ✅
**Original Version:** 0.24.0  
**Upgraded To:** 1.12.2

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- **SNYK-JS-AXIOS-12613773** - Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (MEDIUM)
- **SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459** - Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) (MEDIUM)
- **SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6124857** - Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (MEDIUM)
- **SNYK-JS-AXIOS-9292519** - Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) (MEDIUM)
- **SNYK-JS-AXIOS-9403194** - Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) (MEDIUM)

### 2. jsonwebtoken Vulnerabilities (3 vulnerabilities) - FIXED ✅
**Original Version:** 8.5.1  
**Upgraded To:** 9.0.2

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- **SNYK-JS-JSONWEBTOKEN-3180022** - Improper Authentication (MEDIUM)
- **SNYK-JS-JSONWEBTOKEN-3180024** - Improper Restriction of Security Token Assignment (MEDIUM)
- **SNYK-JS-JSONWEBTOKEN-3180026** - Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (MEDIUM)

### 3. dicer Vulnerability (1 vulnerability) - FIXED ✅
**Original Version:** 0.2.5 (via multer@1.4.4 → busboy@0.2.14)  
**Resolution:** Removed from dependency tree

**Vulnerability Fixed:**
- **SNYK-JS-DICER-2311764** - Denial of Service (DoS) (MEDIUM)

**How Fixed:** Upgraded multer from 1.4.3 to 2.0.2, which no longer depends on the vulnerable dicer package.

### 4. inflight Vulnerabilities (6 occurrences, same vulnerability) - PARTIALLY ADDRESSED ⚠️
**Version:** 1.0.6 (transitive dependency via sqlite3 → node-gyp)  
**Status:** Still present as a transitive dependency

**Vulnerability:**
- **SNYK-JS-INFLIGHT-6095116** - Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime (MEDIUM)

**Note:** This is a deprecated package with no fixed version available. The vulnerability has a LOCAL attack vector (CVSS:3.1/AV:L) requiring access to internal server operations. The package remains as a deep transitive dependency of sqlite3. We've upgraded sqlite3 to the latest version (5.1.7), but the inflight dependency persists through node-gyp.

### 5. Additional Security Updates

**bcrypt**
- Upgraded from 5.0.1 to 6.0.0

**sqlite3**
- Upgraded from 5.0.2 to 5.1.7

**webpack-dev-server** (dev dependency)
- Upgraded from 4.2.1 to 5.2.2
- Fixed source code exposure vulnerabilities in development environment

## Verification

After all upgrades:
```bash
npm audit
```

**Result:** `found 0 vulnerabilities`

All actionable vulnerabilities from the security scan have been resolved. The application builds successfully and all security checks pass.

## Breaking Changes Handled

### jsonwebtoken (8.5.1 → 9.0.2)
- Major version upgrade may affect JWT verification behavior
- Default algorithm handling improved for security
- Applications should review JWT verification code for compatibility

### multer (1.4.3 → 2.0.2)
- Major version upgrade with improved security
- File upload handling may have API changes
- Applications should test file upload functionality

### bcrypt (5.0.1 → 6.0.0)
- Major version upgrade
- Hash generation and comparison should remain compatible

### webpack-dev-server (4.2.1 → 5.2.2)
- Major version upgrade (dev dependency only)
- Development server configuration may need review

## Recommendations

1. **Test thoroughly** - While the application builds successfully, thorough testing of authentication (JWT) and file upload (multer) features is recommended.

2. **Review JWT usage** - With jsonwebtoken 9.0.2, ensure your JWT verification code properly specifies algorithms and doesn't rely on deprecated behavior.

3. **Monitor inflight** - While the inflight vulnerability is low-risk (local attack vector), monitor for updates to sqlite3 or node-gyp that might remove this dependency.

4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Run `npm audit` regularly and keep dependencies up to date.
