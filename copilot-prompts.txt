Based on the security vulnerability report in vulnerability-data/vulnerability-context.md, please provide specific fixes for the Node.js/npm project vulnerabilities:

1. Analyze each vulnerability and determine the best fix approach
2. Generate specific npm commands to update vulnerable packages
3. Identify any potential breaking changes or compatibility issues
4. Suggest alternative packages if direct updates aren't available
5. Provide code-level fixes if the vulnerabilities are in application code

Focus on:
- High and critical severity vulnerabilities
- Dependency updates that maintain compatibility
- Security best practices for Node.js applications
- Minimal disruption to existing functionality
