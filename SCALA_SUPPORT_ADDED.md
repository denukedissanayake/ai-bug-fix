# âœ… Scala Support Added

## Overview
Scala language support has been successfully added to the multi-language security scanning solution.

## What Was Added

### 1. Language Detection
- **Detection Files**: `build.sbt`, `build.sc`
- **Build Tools**: sbt (Scala Build Tool), Mill
- Automatically detects Scala projects and selects appropriate scanner

### 2. Scanner Support
- **Default Scanner**: Trivy (free, universal scanner)
- **Alternative Scanner**: Snyk (if token provided)
- Scala doesn't have a dedicated free security scanner like other languages, so we use Trivy which supports Scala/JVM projects excellently

### 3. Package Manager Integration
- **Build Tools**: sbt, Mill
- **Fix Commands**: Comments in issues guide users to update `build.sbt` or `build.sc`
- **Package Manager Name**: sbt/Mill

### 4. Fix Command Format
GitHub issues will show:
```bash
# Update version in build.sbt or build.sc for package-name
# Then update version to fixed-version in your build file
```

## How It Works

### Auto-Detection Example
```yaml
# Place in any Scala project with build.sbt
jobs:
  scan:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/security-scan-reusable.yml
    secrets:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Detection Process:**
1. Workflow finds `build.sbt` or `build.sc`
2. Sets language to "scala"
3. Selects Trivy scanner (or Snyk if token provided)
4. Runs `sbt update` to fetch dependencies
5. Scans with Trivy
6. Creates issues with Scala-specific fix instructions

### Manual Override
```yaml
jobs:
  scan:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/security-scan-reusable.yml
    with:
      language: 'scala'
      scanner: 'trivy'  # or 'snyk'
    secrets:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scala Project
```yaml
name: Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'

jobs:
  scan:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/security-scan-reusable.yml
    secrets:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### With Snyk for Better Coverage
```yaml
jobs:
  scan:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/security-scan-reusable.yml
    with:
      scanner: 'snyk'
    secrets:
      SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Monorepo with Scala and Other Languages
```yaml
jobs:
  scan-all:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - dir: 'frontend'
            lang: 'nodejs'
          - dir: 'backend-scala'
            lang: 'scala'
          - dir: 'services'
            lang: 'go'
    uses: ./.github/workflows/security-scan-reusable.yml
    with:
      working-directory: ${{ matrix.dir }}
      language: ${{ matrix.lang }}
```

## Why Trivy for Scala?

Unlike Node.js (npm audit), Python (pip-audit), or Rust (cargo-audit), Scala doesn't have a dedicated free security scanner. However:

1. **Trivy is excellent for JVM/Scala**:
   - Scans JAR files and dependencies
   - Supports sbt and Maven/Gradle
   - Large vulnerability database
   - Free and open source

2. **Snyk is the premium option**:
   - Best Scala support available
   - Deep dependency analysis
   - Code scanning included
   - Requires paid account

3. **Why not OWASP Dependency Check?**:
   - OWASP is Java-focused
   - Trivy is faster and more modern
   - Better CI/CD integration

## Scala Build Tools Supported

### sbt (Scala Build Tool)
- **Detection**: `build.sbt`
- **Install Command**: `sbt update`
- **Most Common**: Used by majority of Scala projects

### Mill
- **Detection**: `build.sc`
- **Install Command**: `mill resolve _`
- **Modern Alternative**: Fast, simpler than sbt

## Complete Language Support

The solution now supports **9 languages**:
1. âœ… Node.js
2. âœ… Python
3. âœ… Rust
4. âœ… **Scala** (NEW!)
5. âœ… Java
6. âœ… Go
7. âœ… .NET/C#
8. âœ… Ruby
9. âœ… PHP

## Testing Recommendations

### For Scala Projects:
1. Test with a simple sbt project
2. Verify Trivy finds vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. Check GitHub issue format is correct
4. Test with Snyk scanner if you have a token

### Example Test Project:
```scala
// build.sbt
name := "test-project"
version := "0.1"
scalaVersion := "2.13.8"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-actor" % "2.6.0",  // Intentionally old version
  "org.json4s" %% "json4s-native" % "3.5.0"      // Intentionally old version
)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for Scala support:
- [ ] Add Coursier-based vulnerability checking
- [ ] Support for Scala 3 (Dotty) projects
- [ ] Integration with Scalameta for code analysis
- [ ] sbt plugin for inline scanning

## Summary

âœ… **Scala is now fully supported** in the multi-language security scanner!

- **Auto-detects** Scala projects
- **Uses Trivy** (free) or Snyk (premium)
- **Creates proper GitHub issues** with Scala-specific fix commands
- **Zero configuration** needed
- **Works across repositories**

Your Scala projects now have the same automated security scanning as all other supported languages! ðŸŽ‰
