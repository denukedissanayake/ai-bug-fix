# Migration Guide: From Monolithic to Modular Architecture

This guide helps you transition from the original monolithic `security-scan.yml` workflow to the new production-ready modular architecture.

## üìä Architecture Comparison

### Before: Monolithic Workflow
```
security-scan.yml (500+ lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Job: vulnerability-detection
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Checkout
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Setup Node
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Install dependencies
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Install Snyk
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authenticate Snyk
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run dependency scan
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run code scan
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Merge results (complex bash)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extract vulnerabilities (complex jq)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate reports (complex jq)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Upload artifacts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Job: create-vulnerability-issue
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Download artifacts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Create issue (200+ lines of JavaScript)
```

### After: Modular Architecture
```
security-scan-reusable.yml (60 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Job: vulnerability-detection
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Checkout
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scan-vulnerabilities action
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process-vulnerabilities action
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Upload artifacts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Job: create-vulnerability-issue
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Download artifacts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ create-security-issue action

Composite Actions:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scan-vulnerabilities/ (80 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process-vulnerabilities/ (150 lines)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ create-security-issue/ (250 lines)
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Migration

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Maintainability** | Single 500+ line file | 3 focused components (~80-250 lines each) |
| **Reusability** | Copy-paste entire workflow | Import as reusable workflow or actions |
| **Testing** | Test entire workflow | Test individual components |
| **Customization** | Modify monolithic file | Swap or extend specific actions |
| **Debugging** | Debug 500 lines | Debug focused components |
| **Documentation** | Single README | Component-specific docs |
| **Version Control** | One version | Independent component versions |

## üîÑ Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Workflow

```bash
# Backup your current workflow
cp .github/workflows/security-scan.yml .github/workflows/security-scan.yml.backup
```

### Step 2: Create Composite Actions

The composite actions have been created for you:
- `.github/actions/scan-vulnerabilities/action.yml` ‚úÖ
- `.github/actions/process-vulnerabilities/action.yml` ‚úÖ
- `.github/actions/create-security-issue/action.yml` ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Create Reusable Workflow

The reusable workflow has been created:
- `.github/workflows/security-scan-reusable.yml` ‚úÖ

### Step 4: Choose Your Migration Strategy

#### Strategy A: Full Migration (Recommended)

Replace your current workflow with the new caller:

```bash
# Rename old workflow
mv .github/workflows/security-scan.yml .github/workflows/security-scan-old.yml

# Use the new caller workflow
mv .github/workflows/security-scan-caller.yml .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
```

**Pros:**
- Clean break, fully modular
- Easy to understand
- Production-ready immediately

**Cons:**
- Requires confidence in new system
- All changes at once

#### Strategy B: Gradual Migration

Run both workflows in parallel:

```yaml
# Keep security-scan.yml as is
# Add security-scan-caller.yml alongside it
# Compare results
# Switch when confident
```

**Pros:**
- Safe, can compare results
- Test new system thoroughly
- Rollback easily

**Cons:**
- Runs twice (uses more Actions minutes)
- More complex during transition

#### Strategy C: Hybrid Approach

Use the old workflow but gradually replace steps with composite actions:

```yaml
name: Security Scan (Hybrid)

jobs:
  vulnerability-detection:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # NEW: Use composite action
      - uses: ./.github/actions/scan-vulnerabilities
        with:
          snyk-token: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      
      # OLD: Keep existing processing steps temporarily
      - name: Extract vulnerabilities (old way)
        run: |
          # Your existing bash/jq logic
          ...
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal risk
- Incremental changes
- Learn the new system step-by-step

**Cons:**
- Longer migration period
- Mixed architecture temporarily

### Step 5: Update Secrets and Permissions

Ensure your repository has the required secrets:

```bash
# Check existing secrets
gh secret list

# Add if missing
gh secret set SNYK_TOKEN
gh secret set GH_TOKEN
```

Verify workflow permissions in `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read
  security-events: write
```

### Step 6: Test the New Workflow

```bash
# Trigger manually via CLI
gh workflow run security-scan-caller.yml

# Or via UI
# Go to Actions ‚Üí Security Scan Caller ‚Üí Run workflow

# Monitor the run
gh run watch
```

### Step 7: Validate Results

Check that:
- ‚úÖ Scan completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Vulnerabilities are detected (if any exist)
- ‚úÖ Artifacts are uploaded
- ‚úÖ Issues are created (if vulnerabilities found)
- ‚úÖ Copilot assignment works
- ‚úÖ Labels are applied correctly

### Step 8: Clean Up

Once satisfied:

```bash
# Remove old workflow
rm .github/workflows/security-scan.yml.backup
# or
git rm .github/workflows/security-scan-old.yml

# Commit changes
git add .github/
git commit -m "Migrate to modular security scanning architecture"
git push
```

## üîç Detailed Component Mapping

### Scanning Logic Migration

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Install Snyk CLI
  run: npm install -g snyk

- name: Authenticate Snyk
  run: snyk auth ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}

- name: Run Snyk dependency scan
  run: snyk test --json > dependency-scan-results.json || true

- name: Run Snyk code scan
  run: snyk code test --json > code-scan-results.json || true

- name: Merge scan results
  run: |
    # 30+ lines of bash/jq
```

**After:**
```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/scan-vulnerabilities
  with:
    snyk-token: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

### Processing Logic Migration

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Extract high-risk vulnerabilities
  run: |
    # 80+ lines of jq and bash
    
- name: Extract fixable vulnerabilities
  run: |
    # 100+ lines of jq and bash
```

**After:**
```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/process-vulnerabilities
  with:
    scan-results-path: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.scan-results-path }}
    repository: ${{ github.repository }}
```

### Issue Creation Migration

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Create consolidated vulnerability issue
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      // 200+ lines of JavaScript
```

**After:**
```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/create-security-issue
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    vulnerability-data-path: 'vulnerability-data/detailed-vulnerabilities.json'
    repository: ${{ github.repository }}
    run-id: ${{ github.run_id }}
    server-url: ${{ github.server_url }}
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Changes

### Old Configuration Method

All configuration was hardcoded in the workflow:

```yaml
# Hardcoded in workflow
node-version: '18'
# No way to override without editing file
```

### New Configuration Method

Flexible inputs:

```yaml
jobs:
  security-scan:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/security-scan-reusable.yml
    with:
      node-version: '20'  # Easy to override!
      working-directory: './backend'
      create-issue: false
```

## üêõ Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: Actions Not Found

**Error:**
```
Error: Unable to resolve action `./.github/actions/scan-vulnerabilities`
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure directory structure is correct
ls -la .github/actions/scan-vulnerabilities/
# Should contain action.yml

# Ensure checkout happens first
- uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Must be first!
- uses: ./.github/actions/scan-vulnerabilities
```

### Issue 2: Outputs Not Working

**Error:**
```
Error: Unrecognized named-value: 'steps.scan.outputs.scan-results-path'
```

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Ensure you reference the correct step ID
- name: Run scan
  id: scan  # ‚Üê Must have an ID
  uses: ./.github/actions/scan-vulnerabilities

- name: Use output
  run: echo "${{ steps.scan.outputs.scan-results-path }}"
  #              ^^^^  ‚Üê Must match the ID
```

### Issue 3: Permissions Error

**Error:**
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Add permissions at job or workflow level
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
```

### Issue 4: Secret Not Found

**Error:**
```
Error: Secret SNYK_TOKEN is not set
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add the secret
gh secret set SNYK_TOKEN --body "your-token-here"

# Or check if it exists
gh secret list
```
